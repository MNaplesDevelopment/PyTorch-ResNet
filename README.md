# PyTorch-ResNet

Experimenting with Residual Networks. I'm currently getting an accuracy of 83% after 10 epochs, which could be a lot better and I plan to keep experimenting with the architure and hyperparameters. I would also like to look into a differentiating learning rate that Jeremy Howard describes in the courses at [fast.ai](http://fast.ai) which he uses to get world class results. The network is currently 16 layers deep with 6 skip connections.
